Real-world data (RWD) in healthcare is crucial for generating real-world evidence (RWE) and providing insights beyond clinical trial limitations. In the context of multiple sclerosis (MS), RWD allows valuable insights into this chronic, incurable autoimmune disease of the central nervous system.

To expand and collaborate with other RWD sources like electronic healthcare records (EHR), investigating initiatives for standardising RWD in healthcare is necessary. OHDSI is an initiative that uses the OMOP common data model to standardise healthcare RWD.

The SwitchBox is a tool that automatically transforms source data in a certain format into the OMOP common data model, lowering the barrier to become part of the OHDSI community and to collaborate with data partners from within the MS community and beyond.
