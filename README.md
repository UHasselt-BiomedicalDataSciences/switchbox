# SwitchBox

## Summary

A vast amount of real-world data on multiple sclerosis (MS) is distributed across various global registries. To improve collaboration among these registries, there is need for a unified globally recognized data format. The SwitchBox is designed to assist data custodians in converting their data into this globally recognized data format using a tool that can be easily operated at a local level.

The SwithBox is part of Tine Parciak's PhD research titled "Harmonisation strategies for real-world multiple sclerosis data sources."
